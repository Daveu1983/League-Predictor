# League-Predictor
Not yet complete and there is an issue when moving from 93/94 season to 94/95 season as the number of teams in the league drops.
Ultimately I want a programme that will predict the premier league based. I will do this by looking at previous years position for
a team and then seeing where the tea in that position has finished most often the year after.

UPDATE 3/1/17
Changed the structure so that each year will have it's own class, following on 93/94 season each class will be a subclass of 93/94 (may possibly add abstract class i the future). LeaguePredictor.java will be used to create league objects and apply methods t them.
